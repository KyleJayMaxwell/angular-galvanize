## Why learn Angular JS over other frameworks like Ember, Backbone, Knockout, etc?
There are many reasons to learn Angular, but here are some that I found. It was created in 2009, shortly after it was made one of the engineers who founded it was able to take an app, that was 17,000 lines of code and took 6 months to build, and recreate it in 3 weeks with around 1000 lines of code. The Angular community is massive, with more modules, stackover flow questions, and even stars on github. It is also backed by google.

## People have some very strong opinions about Angular. What are 3 common complaints people have about Angular?
From what I could gather from older articles, is 1. Learning Curve, 2. Scopes and 3. Docs. Learning curve meaning that while it's easy to get into, it's hard to get deeper into it. Scopes is that debugging one is hard. Docs, is the lack of them. 

##Is Angular an MVC framework?
Yes Angular is an MVC. Model is just data, either from dynamic or a database, which Angular has. View is how it displays the module( your data ), angular uses double curly brackets. Controller is what gives us control of how data is retrieved and displayed to end-user. 

##Turn to the Angular docs. Find ng-app. What is it and what does it do? What does ng stand for?
ng stands for angular, an abbreviation. It's just so when angular is shipped out there is uniformity for the built in directives.
